# Data-Engineer-Intership-Report
This is my internship report with Data Engineer role in [**FPT Information System (FIS)**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fptis/mycompany/)

I started my internship since the middle of July, 2022. I was introduced to the company by a brother who is a former president of the HRTech club as a Data Engineer trainee. In first two months, I spent my whole time reading two books that my mentor and leader of Data team gave to me which are **The Analytics Setup Guidebook** by holistic and **Building a Data Warehouse** by author **Vincent Rainardi** (I attached two reports respectively of them). During this period, I had read, researched and got experiments about what is a data warehouse system, components that inside it, how all of them work together and many things related to it, then I wrote all of them in my two reports.   

After completing those reports, I began to learn C# which is the main programming language in my company's source code. Because I have had material of several programming languages which are similar to C# such as C++ or Java, It did not take me much time to get the basic knowledge of C# (about half of month). Next, to serve the demand of the role in FIS, I had to learn more lore about advanced C#. I had to learn more about Delegate, Lambda function, LINQ, Multithreading async, Dependency Injection, etc. 

In October, my team was assigned to a real task from our leader. Requirement for this task is we can give to client (in this situation the client is our leader) a business analysis report of 1st sale room and 2nd sale room of **Rang Dong** Light Source & Vacuum Flask Joint Stock Company in fiscal year 2021 and 2022. This link is directed to location that my team managed, arranaged and followed our task progress [Rang Dong business analysis report](https://www.notion.so/data-tts-fpt/29cc42be39604f46b06a47f7b1fdd5bd?v=407b21d12cbf4558aab902c5fd1e942c). We completed this task within about three weeks

In November, my all objective wass to refractor my code so that our prorject could operate with absolute accuracy and sufficient speed

In the middle of December, I was assigned to second real project from my mentor. She required me to program ETL pipelines, actually this request for me in both of tasks was similar. Nevertheless, in this task I improved my project operation by developing `Incremental load algorithm` which ameliorated the speed of performance remarkably. [*This link*](https://www.notion.so/FPT-Information-System-5a14447523424b28a2cee8c63bf9bf17) is navigated to web page that I used to manage my project, including detailed workflow plan, deadline of each step and so on.

All of my source code is in repository [**Inrership-Project-Data-Engineer-FIS**](https://github.com/duyhuwng2910/Internship-Project-Data-Engineer-FIS)

That is all about my internshp with Data Engineer role in FIS. During that time and until December 2024, I continue to study a bachelor's program in information technology at the [**University of Technology and Engineering**](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn), [**Vietnam National University, Hanoi**](https://vnu.edu.vn/home/).
